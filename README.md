## Introduce Student

### App Description

This is an application that allows us (the users) to introduce ourselves. 

The users can provide the following to create a custom introduction alert with a click of a button:

1. Their first, last, and school name (text fields)
2. Their academic year (segmented control bar)
3. Number of pets (label and stepper)
4. A statement about wanting more pets or not (switch)

### App Walk-though

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.
